# Personal Website — Samuel Zhang

This repository hosts my personal website, built using GitHub Pages. The site serves as a public-facing professional profile that complements my resume and presents my academic, research, and technical experience for a broad audience.

## Purpose and Audience

The website is intended for:
- Recruiters and hiring committees
- Faculty advisors
- Potential collaborators

Unlike a resume or cover letter, which are tailored to specific positions, this site provides a general overview of my background, interests, and selected work in computer science. The content is intentionally concise, skimmable, and aligned with professional conventions.

## Contents
