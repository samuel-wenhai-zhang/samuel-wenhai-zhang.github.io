# Personal Website — Samuel Zhang

This repository hosts my personal website built with GitHub Pages. The site functions as a
public-facing professional profile that presents my background, experience, and interests
in computer science for a broad audience.

## Purpose and Audience

The website is intended for:
- Recruiters and hiring committees
- Faculty advisors
- Potential collaborators

Rather than duplicating application materials, the site provides a concise, narrative
overview of my work and technical focus. It is designed to stand on its own while remaining
consistent with my resume and other professional documents.

## Contents

- `index.html` — Main site content (single-page layout)
- `styles.css` — Minimal, readable styling

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a public repository named:
   `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
2. Upload all files to the repository root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Under *Build and deployment*:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save changes.

The site will be available at:
`https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`

## Customization

Edit `index.html` to update text, projects, or links.
Edit `styles.css` to adjust layout or visual styling.

The site is intentionally simple to emphasize clarity, readability, and professional
presentation.

Personal and educational use only.
